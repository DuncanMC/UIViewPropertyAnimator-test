UIViewPropertyAnimator test

This project demonstrates the new `UIViewPropertyAnimator` class that was added to iOS 10.

A `UIViewPropertyAnimator` allows you to easily create UIView-based animations that can be paused, reversed, and scrubbed back and forth. 

It used to be that you had to use low-level `CAAnimation` objects in order to do these things.
